# You can use the function "digitize" but I'm going
# to show another functino
# data.1 = digitize(cal,col ="red")

# Here, after running this function, click on the points
# data.1 = DigitData(col ="red")
# Calibrate the x and y axes
# data.2 = Calibrate(data.1,cal,
                   # x1 = 1, x2 = 5,
                   # y1 = 7, y2 = 9.5)
# Show the data!
